Hello there and welcome to my project. 

Main topic of this project is to create and test a firewall log analyzer. The API will be used to direct user after supplementing an input log. The purpose of the analyzer is to digest universal log data and find malicious activities and movements. 

We will use free tools and programs like fastapi and uvicorn.
